        "Assume that you have an objective function that needs to be optimized (either maximized or minimized) at a given point. A Greedy algorithm makes greedy choices at each step to ensure that the objective function is optimized. The Greedy algorithm has only one shot to compute the optimal solution so that it never goes back and reverses the decision.\n",

All the greedy problems share a common property that a local optima can eventually lead to a global minima without reconsidering the set of choices already considered.\n",
